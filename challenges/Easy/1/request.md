# [Easy] - Coding Challenge 1

### Problem explanation

Imagine you're navigating a Cartesian plane where movement is allowed in any of the following 8 directions: right, left, up, down, up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right.

You are provided with a series of points on this plane that you need to visit in a specific order. Your task is to determine the minimum number of steps required to visit all the points, starting from the first one.

Example:

`Input: [(-1, -1), (0, 0), (0, 4), (0,3)]`

`Output: 6`

It takes 1 move to go from (-1, -1) to (1, 1). It takes four more step to move from (0, 0) to (0, 3)
and another step to move from (0, 4) to (0, 3).
